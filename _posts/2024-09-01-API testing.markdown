description: To expand my testing skills, I'm currently working on a personal project focused on building and testing an API. I've kept the functionality simple so I can develop the API myself, allowing me to better understand the system I'm testing. The project involves creating a basic book collection system where users can add and remove books, along with some key identifying details. My goal is to create a suite of automated API tests using both Postman and Cypress, allowing me to compare the two tools and determine which is more effective for my needs.
