Having come to this position with no formal software testing training I have had to learn quickly and build fomr the ground up an entire testing process for the company.  Following learning x,y z I completed ISTQB foundation level in testing to conglomerate my learning and better understand industry standards/expectations of testing and the QA process to then apply to my own process.
