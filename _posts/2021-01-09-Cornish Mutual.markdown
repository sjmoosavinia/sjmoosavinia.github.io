description: <p> In my current role at Cornish Mutual, I am the sole tester for the development team and so I'm responsible for testing all of our inhouse and customer facing web applications, at all test levels. Having come to this position with no formal software testing training, I have had to learn quickly and build, from the ground up an entire testing process for the company.  Following learning about the software development lifecycle, manual and automated testing, and how to apply this in an agile environment, I completed the ISTQB foundation level in testing to better direct my learning and better understand industry standards and the expectations of testing to then apply all of this to my own process. </p> <p>As a lone tester I have found automation testing to be really valuable allowing for me to create suites of regression tests that run each time a new build is pushed, this has given me handle on quality despite a number of different systems being work on at the same time. This has also had an impact on the team allowing for more of an agile approach to be adopted for our development process. </p> <p> The part of my work I enjoy the most however is interacting with members of other departments to identify the problems they are facing, so that we can design tech based solutions to solve these problems. These problems are broken down into comprehesvie user stories by working with project managers, developers and business owners, to identify all the behaviours required by the software. These are written using BDD principals and go on to form the basis of all development and testing work carried out on the project. </p>
