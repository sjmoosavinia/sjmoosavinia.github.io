description: Elgol Fund for Nature is a grant giving charity focused on funding gaps in conservation efforts within the UK. I am currently consulting on the digital strategy for the organisation, focusing on how to gather, manage, and store applications for funding ... considerations. I have designed and built the company website, initially using WordPress for speed, but gradually incorporating custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to add more complex functionality. I'm aiming to improve the site further, with the potential to move away from hosting the site through WordPress for greater creative control and a more complex funcitonality that will be required. This role also gives me the opportunity to explore development work, while also being able to think about how test features as they're being created.
