description: I'm constantly looking for new tools to learn/aid in my testing. Cypress took an interest after finding selenium set up difficult to maintain. Built a set of test for this very website and implemented a build pipeline to runs the tests in through Github actions. Gave me a chance to work in JavaScript, test my automation skill in new setting found easy of set up and the speed of writing comprehesive tests great, can also see the leaner code being more easily readable maintainable. Check out the code base here:.
