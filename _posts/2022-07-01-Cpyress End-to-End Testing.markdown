description: I'm constantly looking for new tools to learn as well as aid in my testing. I took an interest in Cypress after initially learning test automation with selenium in which I found the selenium grid set up difficult to maintain. I have begun to built a set of test for this very website and implemented a build pipeline to runs the tests through Github actions. This has given me a chance to work in JavaScript, and test my automation skills in new setting in which I have found the easy of set up and the speed of writing comprehesive end-to-end tests great, can also see the leaner code being more easily readable maintainable if another automation tester was to look at my work.
