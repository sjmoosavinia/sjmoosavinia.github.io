description: At Bluefruit, I joined an embedded software team working on projects in MedTech, aerospace, and infrastructure, all with a strong quality-first approach. I built on my testing skills while gaining hands-on experience with Agile software development in an organization with a well-established, mature process. With the process running smoothly, I was able to focus on other aspects of testing, including automation, effective reporting to paying clients, and hands-on device/hardware testing. I left with a deeper appreciation for Agile methodologies and valuable experience in applying them effectively to the software testing process. <br /><b>Comapny Website <a href="https://bluefruit.co.uk/" target="_blank">bluefruit.co.uk/</a></b>
