                    <p>I am a keen problem solver who enjoys taking the initiative to learn and develop new skills which I am passionate about. Iâ€™m inspired by the power of new technology and want to use it in a career in which I can help pursue positive change. I have redirected my path towards software testing as I have found my ability to listen and understand users problems makes me well suited to supporting developers to solve those problems and solve them well.</p>
